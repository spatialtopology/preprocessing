delete	Failed pain run. No behavioral data	delete	sub-0084_ses-03_task-social_acq-mb8_run-03	"PVC: skipped pain runs (03+06) due to 8007 error. Details: the TSA had passed the safety test and successfully ran with matlab pretest before setting up the participant. When starting the first pain run, I noticed medoc wasn't making the usual trigger sound but the participant was still making ratings (she later confirmed verbally she did not feel pain stimulus). I pulled up medoc and saw that everything was greyed out and there was an error message about failing the pre-test even though the TSA unit itself was still green. I restarted matlab, stopped the run, and detached the thermode from the participant before redoing the safety test, which is when 8007 error first appeared. 
Align videos: participant hit the emergency ball to report that the trackball stopped working properly. She verified that it had been working up until that point. We re-calibrated and went ahead to the next run. Issue was reported a little less than halfway through (circa the car flood video)."

I restarted matlab, stopped the run, and detached the thermode from the participant before redoing the safety test, which is when 8007 error first appeared.
